# CS Autoexec

This is my personal autoexec configuration. I have cloned the repository directly to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`, which means I only have to add the following string to CS' launch options:

`+exec cs-autoexec/autoexec.cfg`
